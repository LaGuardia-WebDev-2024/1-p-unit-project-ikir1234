        The National Park Service was established on August 25, 1916, through an act signed by 
        then-president Woodrow Wilson and other founders that include Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir.
        The first national park, however, was <u>Yellowstone National Park</u> and was designated National Park on March 1,
        1872 by Ulysses S. Grant. 
      </p>

        Today, there are more than <strong>431</strong> units that include national monuments, national sites, 
        national reserves, etc. <mark>However, there are <strong>63</strong> sites that are designated

        Because of the diverse amount of ecosystems and terrain at Olympic National Park, it also holds a 
        <em>unique</em> community of animals. Offshore, is the Pacific Ocean that is home to dolphins, sea otters, 
        sea lions, seals, and the occasion whales as well.  On land, animals found include beavers, racoons, minks,
        elks, cougars, and bears.

        One of the most <strong>iconic</strong> National Parks in the USA, the Grand Canyon National Park is located
        in the northern region of Arizona and is a total length <strong>277</strong> miles. The Grand Canyon is
        shaped the way it is today because of the Colorado River, the 5th longest river in the US, spanning a total
        of 1,450 miles.

      <p>
        Of the very few National Parks in the East of America, the Everglades National Park that's located on the
        southern tip of Florida is a <em>one-of-a-kind.</em> Everglades National Park was created in 1947 and 
        is the <mark>largest tropical wilderness</mark> in America, and protects about 20% of the original Everglades in Florida.

      <p>
        The Everglades are home to a wide array of animals, ranging from the American Alligator and Crocodile,
        black bears, raccoons, spoonbills, manatees, and dolphins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I only went through three National Parks, hopefully you can see the wide arrange of wilderness 
        America has to offer, and the beauty of it, and how important the preservation of these places are.
