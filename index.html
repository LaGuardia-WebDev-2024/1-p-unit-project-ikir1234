        The National Park Service was established on August 25, 1916, through an act signed by 
        then-president Woodrow Wilson and other founders that include Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir.
        The first national park, however, was Yellowstone National Park and was designated National Park on March 1,
        1872 by Ulysses S. Grant.
